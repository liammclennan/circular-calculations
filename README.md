Circular Calculations
=====================

This is an exercise involving circles. We begin by plotting points on a circle, then investigating the distances between those points and the relationship with the circles diameter.

The file `Tests.fs` contains a number of failing tests. The file `Circles.fs` contains corresponding function stubs. Complete the exercise by modifying `Circles.fs` so that the tests pass.
